# Segmentation

We studied and compared the performance of unsupervised, semi and fully-supervised approaches for segmentation.

-  For supervised benchmarking, we use, [ DEDL](https://github.com/pranavsinghps1/DEDL/tree/main/Segmentation%20with%20APP). DEDL uses an autoencoder for post-processing with a U-Net.
- For semi-supervised learning, we used a co-teaching transformer and CNN architecture. The code can be found under the semi-supervised folder in this repository.
- We use the code provided [ here](https://github.com/Shra1-25/PiCIE) for unsupervised benchmarking.
